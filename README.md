How the Application Works:
The project is a simple interactive decision tree for travel recommendations. Users answer three questions about their travel preferences (location, type of experience, and budget), and the app generates a recommendation based on their inputs. The logic is handled via reusable JavaScript functions, while HTML and CSS manage the structure and style.

Research:
I explored how to structure decision trees in JavaScript using nested objects. I also studied responsive web design techniques to ensure the app works well on all devices. Additionally, I implemented CSS animations for better user experience.

Future Improvements:

Add more categories or questions for detailed recommendations.
Use a database for dynamic content updates.
Implement machine learning to provide personalized suggestions.
